## Define in your own works what HTML is?
I would say that HTML is a programming-language, which is used to construct different type of content of the internet. HTML is often the foundation/blueprint on how webcontent is organized. 

## Define in your own words "how does the web work?"
I think of the web as a big gathering of "shops" (servers), where different servers have different content you might want to access. So when you want to read news for example on the web, you would need a way to adress all the different "shops" to find the content you are looking for. So using an Url as an identifier to fetch the correct "shop" (server), and then do a request to the "shop" for the content you would want to see. Then the content gets transfered via a protocol(HTTP/HTTPS) back to your computer, and den rendered so that you can display the content on you screen.
