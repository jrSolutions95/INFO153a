        <h3>What is github and git</h3>
        <p>Git is a version control system, that keeps track of changes in files and directories. You first select a folder/file which you ask Git to pay attention to in terms of versions(new content ect), so if you start with a blank document or folder, it will keep track of all the changes you make in terms of new lines of code, documents added to the folder, or code/documents removed/deleted. This history of files/folders is useful when you want to look back at previous versions, and maybe also roll back to a previous version.</p>
        <p>GitHub is webpage/online service which uses git for version handeling, but also adds a userface for the user, and features for collaborating with other, through different projects, branches, pull requests and review, gihub and git allows its users to share and work togheter on files/projects. Github also allows users to download other peoples code, and use it/ view it (if allowed by the owner)</p>
